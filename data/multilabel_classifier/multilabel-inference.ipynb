The approximate value of the exponent at the\\nextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by\\nintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated\\nnumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic\\nnumerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\\\alpha$ that\\nis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling\\nbetween the variable and the noise. The value of $\\\\alpha$ was restricted not to\\nbe negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent\\ndecreases with $\\\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was\\nalso found that the exponent as a function of $\\\\alpha$ has only one minimum at\\n$\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\\\alpha = 0$. This minimum\\nvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically.
