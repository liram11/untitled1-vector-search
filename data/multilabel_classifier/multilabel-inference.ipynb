The\\nweights depend on a parameter, and we find pointwise bounds for heat kernel, as\\nwell as its derivatives in time, space, and the parameter. We also prove\\ncancellation conditions for the heat semigroup. We reduce the $n$-dimensional\\ncase to the one-dimensional case, and the estimates in one-dimensional case are\\nachieved by Duhamel's principle and commutator properties of the operators. As\\nan application, we recover estimates of heat kernels on polynomial models in\\n$C^2$.\\n\",\n",

Different types of topologies are considered on groups of\\nloops and diffeomorphisms relative to which they are generalized Lie groups or\\ntopological groups. Among such topologies pairwise incomparable are found as\\nwell. Topological perfectness of the diffeomorphism group relative to certain\\ntopologies is studied. There are proved theorems about projective limit\\ndecompositions of these groups and their compactifications for compact\\nmanifolds.

The approximate value of the exponent at the\\nextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by\\nintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated\\nnumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic\\nnumerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\\\alpha$ that\\nis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling\\nbetween the variable and the noise. The value of $\\\\alpha$ was restricted not to\\nbe negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent\\ndecreases with $\\\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was\\nalso found that the exponent as a function of $\\\\alpha$ has only one minimum at\\n$\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\\\alpha = 0$. This minimum\\nvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically. The existence of the minimum\\nat $\\\\alpha \\\\neq 0$ indicates the suppression of the growth by multiplicative\\nwhite noise.\\n',\n",
